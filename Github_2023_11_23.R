#>Now you are ready to start using RStudio and GitHub. There are two main workflows:

#1. Make a new local repo and push it to GitHub
#2. Clone an existing repo from GitHub onto your computer

#option 1
#Create new directory, and tick "create git repository"
#or take an existing prjoect and run "usethis::use_git()"

#Then let RStudio restart so that the git panel is activated.

#Once you have committed at least one file, you can create a repo on GitHub.

#2.7 Stage, commit and push

#>If you create or edit a file in your repository and save the changes the file 
#>will appear in the Git panel. There will be two yellow question marks ? ? if
#> you add a file; a blue M if you edit a file that has already been committed; 
#> a red D if you delete a file. If you move files and they will show up as 
#> deleted and added in the new place. Once you have staged (ticking the box 
#> by the file name) both the deleted and new file, the icon will 
#> become a purple R
